        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Hello, I'm Sam Knight, founder of KnightCycle. KnightCycle began as a simple idea born from a passion I've had for years: 3D printing. I've been part of the community since the early RepRap days of the mid-2000s, watching it grow from experimental opensource projects to the accessible, innovative world we know today. When affordable printers appeared in the 2010s, I was all in.</p>
        <p>Before starting KnightCycle, I earned a BSc in Chemistry and began a PhD in Environmental (Actinide) Chemistry. During that time, I moved into software development, blending scientific problemsolving with technical creativity.</p>
        <p>While working in research, our group acquired one of the early Creality printers, and we even experimented with recycling certain disposable lab consumables. That early exposure to closed-loop recycling process planted a seed that never went away.</p>
        <p>Fast forward: I now run my own 3D printer (with far too many upgrades, a rite of passage!). As projects grew, so did the pile of waste filament. Around the same time, becoming a father made me think harder about the future my son would inherit, and how much waste our hobby, and society, produces. Across the community I kept hearing the same concerns: "There's no affordable way to recycle filament", "Multicolour printing generates so much waste." and "Hobbyists have no affordable option available to them."</p>
        <p>I realised I had the skills, background, and responsibility to help change that, and KnightCycle was born.</p>

        <h3>What Makes KnightCycle Different</h3>
        <p>KnightCycle is about turning passion into purpose: recycling 3D printing waste into high-quality new filament, manufactured within professional tolerances and tested for reliability.</p>
        <p>I'm not driven by profit, I'm driven by impact. If I can cover costs, grow sustainably, and help others reduce waste, that's a win.</p>
        <p>Many recycling options demand large upfront fees and only accept PLA. KnightCycle aims to change that by offering accessible, science-based recycling for multiple filament types. With a background in chemistry, software, and years of hands on printing, I understand both the science and the practical needs of makers.</p>
