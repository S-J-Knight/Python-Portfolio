        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>KnightCycle is on a mission to close the loop in 3D printing, transforming discarded filament into high‑quality, reliable material that makers can trust. We believe sustainability should be accessible, practical, and built into every print.</p>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Hello, I’m Sam Knight, founder of KnightCycle. KnightCycle began as a simple idea born from a passion I’ve had for years: 3D printing. I’ve been part of the community since the early RepRap days of the mid‑2000s, watching it grow from experimental open‑source projects to the accessible, innovative world we know today. When affordable printers appeared in the 2010s, I was all in.</p>
        <p>Before starting KnightCycle, I earned a BSc in Chemistry and began a PhD in Environmental (Actinide) Chemistry. During that time, I moved into software development, blending scientific problem‑solving with technical creativity.</p>
        <p>While working in research, our group acquired one of the early Creality printers, and we even experimented with recycling certain disposable lab consumables. That early exposure to closed‑loop material use planted a seed that never went away.</p>
        <p>Fast forward: I now run my own 3D printer (with far too many upgrades, a rite of passage!). As projects grew, so did the pile of waste filament. Around the same time, becoming a father made me think harder about the future my son would inherit, and how much waste our hobby, and society, produces. Across the community I kept hearing the same concerns: “There’s no affordable way to recycle filament” and “Multicolour printing generates so much waste.”</p>
        <p>I realised I had the skills, background, and responsibility to help change that, and KnightCycle was born.</p>

        <h3>What Makes KnightCycle Different</h3>
        <p>KnightCycle is about turning passion into purpose: recycling 3D printing waste into high‑quality new filament, manufactured within professional tolerances and tested for reliability.</p>
        <p>I’m not driven by profit, I’m driven by impact. If I can cover costs, grow sustainably, and help others reduce waste, that’s a win.</p>
        <p>Many recycling options demand large upfront fees and only accept PLA. KnightCycle aims to change that by offering accessible, science‑based recycling for multiple filament types. With a background in chemistry, software, and years of hands‑on printing, I understand both the science and the practical needs of makers.</p>

        <h3>Our Values</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Every spool of filament can have a second life.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Recycled doesn’t mean compromised, every batch meets professional standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Recycling shouldn’t be limited to big businesses; we make it practical for everyone.</li>
          <li><strong>Community:</strong> We’re part of the same maker movement we serve, building a cleaner future together.</li>
        </ul>
